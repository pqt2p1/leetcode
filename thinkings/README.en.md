# Algorithm Topics

Below are some types of problems I have summarized. Understanding these in advance is very helpful for later problem-solving, and I strongly recommend mastering them first. Additionally, my 91-day algorithm study further organizes these topics into finer details, see [91-day algorithm](../91/README.md) study for specifics

Firstly, mastering the basic data structures is essential, followed by the brute force method. The brute force method is also an algorithm, but we are certainly seeking algorithms with better performance. Therefore, understanding the bottlenecks of brute force methods and the characteristics of various data structures is important, as this knowledge allows you to gradually approach the optimal solution.

Next, there are algorithms that you must master. For example, search algorithms are essential. The scope of search algorithms is broad, but the core is searching. Different algorithms vary in their search methods, with BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) being typical examples. Of course, binary search is also fundamentally a search algorithm.

Additionally, mastering methods to optimize brute force is also essential, and like searching, the scope is broad. This includes techniques like pruning, and space-time trade-offs, among others. Within the space-time trade-offs, there are many methods, such as hash tables and prefix trees, etc.

Embracing this mindset in your study won't lead you far astray. I won't say more; everyone can gradually appreciate it on their own.

## Problem Link (679. 24 Game)

[https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/24-game/](https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game/)

## 题目描述

```
You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9. You should judge whether they could operated through *, /, +, -, (, ) to get the value of 24.

Example 1:

Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24

Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]  
Output: False

Note:
The division operator / represents real division, not integer division. For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operation.
Adding parenthesis by hand is allowed and is operated on the fly.
You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2], we cannot make 12+12.
```

## Prerequisites

- [Backtracking](https://github.com/azl397985856/leetcode/blob/master/thinkings/backtrack.md "回溯")
- Number precision issues
- Divide and conquer

## Thoughts

The problem gives us four numbers and asks us to use the four operations (+, -, *, /) to make 24. Since the data range is only 4, it's feasible to use brute-force backtracking to enumerate all possibilities.

First, we use backtracking to find all permutations of the nums array, which requires enumerating 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 possibilities. Since all four operations are binary (the problem explicitly states that - cannot be used as a unary negation), we can arbitrarily choose any two numbers and enumerate the four operations on them. Since the choice of which two numbers to pick doesn't affect the result, we can simply pick the first two. Next, we take the result of the operation on the first two numbers and continue to use the same method to solve the remaining numbers. In this way, the problem is reduced from size 4 to size 3, and we continue this process until we are left with a single number. If this final number is 24, we return true, otherwise false.

It's worth noting that floating-point division can result in precision errors. Therefore, we need to check if the final result is within a certain precision range of 24, e.g., if the result differs from 24 by less than 10^-6, we consider it to be 24 and return true.

## Key Points

- Use recursion to break the problem down into smaller instances of the same problem
- Control precision by considering two numbers equal if their difference is less than a small value

## Code

- Language：Python3

Python3 Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def judgePoint24(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return math.isclose(nums[0], 24)
        return any(self.judgePoint24([x] + rest) for a, b, *rest in permutations(nums) for x in [a+b, a-b, a*b, b and a/b])
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Since the input size is always 4, the complexity of our algorithm is actually a constant value.

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
